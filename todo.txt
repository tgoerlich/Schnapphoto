- better handling of no camera / no schnappphoto-host
- re-connect to camera if connection is broken (loop)
- restart daemon if got killed
- display camera status (battery, serial, etc)
- bug: re-init fails after daemon kill
- issue: camera is half-locked (does not show pictures) if connected (usb-cable in) - fix?
- add more capturesettings
- add *all* capturesettings (loop)
- tethered mode: bind actions to camera events (i.e. on capture do exif edit, on changed setting do update ui...)
- open file from camera sd card
- write file to camera sd card
- alter exif data
- read out exif thumbnail
- change css (color) at runtime (event: camera found)
- save capture settings as presets (cookie?)
- admin-area: shutdown, restart daemon, set system time / camera time
- fix sunset/sunrise calc

--------------------

- find out if camera is busy, write loop (done for set_capturesetting)
