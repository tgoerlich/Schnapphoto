        <h1>Schnapphoto</h1>

<p>Middleware and webapp-interface to remotely control your digital camera with a mobile device</p>

<h1>About this project</h1>

<p>This project is based on ideas of David Hunt (<a href="http://davidhunt.ie/?p=2641">http://davidhunt.ie/?p=2641</a>) and KÃ¼rth Williams (<a href="http://islandinthenet.com/2012/08/23/hdr-photography-with-raspberry-pi-and-gphoto2/">http://islandinthenet.com/2012/08/23/hdr-photography-with-raspberry-pi-and-gphoto2/</a>) who describe different approaches on how to control a digital camera remotely with a Raspberry Pi mini computer.
The vision is to have a battery powered linux system sitting close to the camera and function as a "second brain" for it, enhancing the built-in features in many ways (bracketing, focus stacking, time lapse, remote control....)</p>

<p>This implementation offers a easy to use HTML5 user interface for remote camera control and a python back-end that communicates with the camera.
The frontend is designed for smart phones (any make/model), it should work with any device supported by jquery mobile (<a href="http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/">http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/</a>)
The backend is aimed to work with all cameras supported by gPhoto2 (<a href="http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php">http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php</a>). </p>

<p>planned features:</p>

<ul>
<li>control camera in a libgphoto-session (keep session open instead of time consuming repeated inits for every shot) [Status: works]</li>
<li>use your mobile device (smartphone) to

<ul>
<li>see and alter capture settings (like aperture, shutter speed etc) [works]</li>
<li>shoot pictures [works]</li>
<li>shoot bracketing series [works]</li>
<li>shoot time lapse series [works]</li>
<li>combined bracketing and time lapse series [works]</li>
<li>monitor camera status (battery life etc) [not implemented yet]</li>
<li>see previews [not implemented yet]</li>
<li>browse camera roll [not implemented yet]</li>
<li>geotag pictures using your smartphone's GPS [not implemented yet]</li>
<li>synchronise client's / camera's clock and timezone [not implemented yet]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h1>Current status</h1>

<p>Right now, the project is still in "proof of concept" status. We have a neat webinterface, camera operations work (read/set capture settings, take pictures, bracketing...)
Next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>read and write back files from camera</li>
<li>cache read-only values from camera (widget options)</li>
<li>dynamically adopt UI to camera capabilities</li>
<li>write GPS data into EXIF block after every shot</li>
<li>enable tethering (initiate actions when camera button is pressed)</li>
<li>write command line interface (alternative to CGI interface for testing)</li>
</ul><h1>How it works</h1>

<p>The backend is mainly running a gphoto session as a daemon. It keeps the connection to the camera open as long as it runs, independent from client. It's routines are called remotely from a CGI-script through the pyro framework.
The CGI-script itself simply translates URL commands into python calls.
The backend heavily relies on piggyphoto, the python bindings for libgphoto</p>

<p>The frontend is based on jquery mobile. It's a mobile web app that queries the backend dynamically through ajax calls.</p>

<h1>System requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li>libghoto2 (deleloped on version 2.5, don't know about earlier versions)</li>
<li>Python 2.7 (didn't try python 3 yet)</li>
<li>These Python modules:

<ul>
<li>Pyro4</li>
<li>Daemon</li>
<li>ctypes</li>
<li>piggyphoto (find it on github, make sure to get the latest version / trunk)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>jquery mobile 1.3.0 (beta)</li>
<li>a webserver (apache), configured to execute CGI scripts</li>
</ul><p>as a client, any recent web browser will do.</p>

<h1>recommended hardware setup</h1>

<ul>
<li>A digital camera that is capable of tethered shootings with gPhoto. I used a Nikon D40X for development.</li>
<li>A linux system that connects to the camera via usb. In my case, it's a Raspberry Pi with the latest Raspbian Wheezy</li>
<li>A Wifi-adapter running in host mode (so you can connect to the host with your smartphone if you do shootings outside)</li>
<li>If you want to move around with your camera and system, a battery power supply my be usefull. I decided to build my own power supply with two LiPo batteries and a step-up DC/DC converter, fitting nicely together with the RasPi and a switch into a little box that sits on the flash mount of my DSLR.</li>
<li>A smartphone or other mobile device with a recent web browser and Wi-Fi. I personally use an iPhone 4.</li>
</ul>
